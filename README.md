# TSCI
The source code of TSCI <br>
This is the implement of our proposed model:DeepTSCI.
# Environment
* python 2.7
* Tensorflow 1.0 or ++
# Trajectory Splitting and POI Embedding
* For capturing the mobility pattern of trajectory, We firstly split the trajectory into sub-trajectoy,the method we have explained in our paper. 
* Next, we make the POIs embedding, the toolkite we used is wordv2vec, and this tool can download and install from website easily.
